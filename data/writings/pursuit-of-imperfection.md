I have always been scared to put myself out there on the internet. I'm paralyzed by indecision, always crafting, always refining, never hitting send.

I want to change that by writing here more. Maybe I'll share thoughts about work - building fintech companies and scaling software. Maybe I'll share thoughts about books or articles I've read. Maybe I'll even share personal stories or feelings.

It's for no-one in particular, it won't be perfect, and that's kinda the point.
